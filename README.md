# Java Fundamentals

## 4 Pillars of OOP

1. **Data Abstraction** - Hiding the implementation and exposing only required details.
E.g. Car brakes

2. **Data Encapsulation** - Bundle data and code working on it in a single unit.
E.g. Medicine capsule

3. **Inheritance** - Inheriting data and behaviors.

4. **Polymorphism** - Multiple behaviors.


## Relationships
<ol>
<li> <strong> IS-A </strong>: Inheritance </li>
<li> <strong> HAS-A </strong>: When one class has the reference(object) of the other class. Can be One-2-One, One-2-Many and Many-2-Many. </li>
<strong> HAS-A </strong> relationship can be of two types: 
<ol>
<li> <strong>Aggregation </strong>: Weak relationship: destroying one doesnâ€™t affect another. </li>
<li> <strong>Composition: </strong> Strong relationship: destroying one destroys the other too. </li>
</ol>
</ol>

<ol>

<li> Java is a platform independent high level and Object-Oriented Programming language. </li>
<li> <strong> WORA </strong> : Work Once Run Anywhere. </li>
</ol>
